# gtkdynamo2

EasyHybrid - GTKDynamo is free/open source software which, together with pDynamo, transforms PyMOL into a powerful interface for molecular modeling. The interface has been designed to facilitate determining reaction pathways in biological systems, specially using hybrid QC/MM (or QM/MM) methods. Pymol has been chosen as a graphical interface to pDynamo because it has a python API with wide documentation available.

Some of the pDynamo capabilities that can be used with the EasyHybrid:

    Pure QC simulations - ab initio and SMO.
    Pure MM simulations - using AMBER, CHARMM or OPLS force fields.
    Hybrid QCMM simulations.
    Single point calculations.
    Energy minimization.
    Molecular dynamics.
    Reaction coordinate scanning.
    Umbrella sampling.
    Reaction path calculations - using NEB.
    and more...
